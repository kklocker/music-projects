# Interval inverter

This was based on a thought I had when looking at how certain jazz-tunes traverse the circle of fifths.

In some cases, there are nice patterns (probably not by accident), and I thought: "What if we go the opposite way?" Proabably not an original thought either but who cares. 

`python .\interval-inverter.py B D G` -> `B G# D#`
